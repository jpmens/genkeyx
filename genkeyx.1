.SH NAME
genkeyx \- generate XML .keyx files for KeePass(XC)
.SH SYNOPSIS
genkeyx [\-o \f[I]file\f[R]] [\-v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[I]genkeyx\f[R] creates a 32\-byte random value and a SHA256 hash of
it and formats these values as an XML document ready for use in KeePass
and/or KeePassXC.

XML (recommended, default).
There is an XML format for key files.
KeePass 2.x uses this format by default, i.e.\ when creating a key file
in the master key dialog, an XML key file is created.
The syntax and the semantics of the XML format allow to detect certain
corruptions (especially such caused by faulty hardware or transfer
problems), and a hash (in XML key files version 2.0 or higher) allows to
verify the integrity of the key.
This format is resistant to most encoding and new\-line character
changes (which is useful for instance when the user is opening and
saving the key file or when transferring it from/to a server).
Such a key file can be printed (as a backup on paper), and comments can
be added in the file (with the usual XML syntax:
\f[CR]<!\-\- ... \-\->\f[R]).
It is the most flexible format; new features can be added easily in the
future.
.RE
.PP
\f[I]genkeyx\f[R] generates 32 bytes of random data, creates a SHA256
hash of that, adds the first four bytes of the hash to
\f[CR]Data Hash\f[R], and appends the prettyfied 32 hexlified bytes to
the XML.
.SH OPTIONS
\f[I]genkeyx\f[R] understands the following global options:
.TP
\-o
Write the XML document into the specified file instead of to
\f[I]stdout\f[R].
.TP
\-v
Show version and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
Create an XML keyx document:
.IP
.EX
$ genkeyx
<?xml version=\[dq]1.0\[dq] encoding=\[dq]UTF\-8\[dq]?>
<KeyFile>
    <Meta>
    <Version>2.0</Version>
    </Meta>
    <Key>
    <Data Hash=\[dq]7CE2614B\[dq]>

    </Data>
    </Key>
</KeyFile>

.SH BUGS
Maybe not.
.SH RETURN CODES
\f[I]genkeyx\f[R] exits with a code 0 on success and non\-zero on
failure after indicating what caused the failure.
